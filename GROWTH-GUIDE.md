## Income Streams to Reach $10K/Month

AdSense alone won't get you to $10K. Combine multiple streams:

| Income Stream | Potential |
|--------------|-----------|
| **AdSense** | $1,000–$5,000 |
| **Mediavine/Raptive** (better ad networks, need 50K+ sessions) | $2,000–$10,000 |
| **Affiliate links** (cleaning products on Amazon) | $1,000–$5,000 |
| **Sponsored posts** (brands pay you to feature products) | $500–$2,000/post |
| **Digital products** (cleaning checklists, ebooks) | $500–$3,000 |

---

## Traffic Sources You Need

Pinterest alone caps at ~$500–$1,500/month. Use multiple sources:

| Source | Why you need it | Potential |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Pinterest** | Quick traffic, visual content | 20–30% of traffic |
| **Google Search (SEO)** | Free, consistent, grows over time | 40–60% of traffic |
| **Facebook Groups** | Easy to share, large cleaning communities | 5–10% of traffic |
| **Reddit** | r/CleaningTips has 1.4M+ members | 5–10% of traffic |
| **Email list** | Your subscribers come back repeatedly | 5–15% of traffic |

### Pinterest vs Google

| Pinterest | Google |
|-----------|--------|
| You share a pin → traffic spike → dies down | You publish a post → slow start → grows for months/years |
| Traffic stops if you stop pinning | Traffic keeps coming even if you stop writing |
| Algorithm-dependent | Keyword-dependent (more predictable) |
